-- BUGS / FIXES / REFACTORS --
[ ] Files aren't always sorted correctly (especially on adding / removing)
[X] Show "add entry file" button only on valid files

-- FEATURES --
[ ] ⭐️ Visualization of variable utilization
    - Track how a variable is referenced across files
[ ] ⭐️ Find imports / exports within file (git diff)
[ ] ⭐️ Slider/input to control dependency depth
[ ] importing types (type, interface, etc) should be counted differently
    - The visualization should have an option to exclude imports which are only types
[ ] Download visualization button
[ ] Create preview panel within visualization webview
[ ] Option to toggle simulation temperature i.e. simulation won't move
[ ] Support online URIs
[X] Use editor background color for settings panel (don't question this)
[X] Minimal filenames
[X] Some way to select two nodes and find all paths between them
    - Idea: Select one node and ctrl+click on the other?

-- COMPLETED --
[X] Create settings panel within visualization webview
[X] Settings panel should have the background AND border of the editor hover widget
[X] refactor: Remove unnecessary comments (force-layout)
[X] refactor: Use Immediately Invoked Function Expressions instead of side effects
[X] docs: dependograph.openFile comment
[X] style: Rename functions (force-layout)

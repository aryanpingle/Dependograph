[ ] feat: Debounce resize listener (visualization.ts)
[ ] refactor: Improve TreeView getChildren logic
[ ] refactor: Use enums and put strings in a constants file
[ ] refactor: Instead of calling functions on document.querySelector, extract the element to const
[ ] refactor: Use packages for common logic (longestCommonPrefix, etc)
[ ] refactor: Use common variables for stuff like vscode.workspace

-- BUGS / FIXES / REFACTORS --
[ ] Show "add entry file" button only on valid files
[ ] Files aren't always sorted correctly (especially on adding / removing)
[ ] Support .mjs and .cjs

-- FEATURES --
[ ] importing types (type, interface, etc) should be counted differently
    - The visualization should have an option to exclude imports which are only types
[ ] Download visualization button
[ ] Find imports / exports within file (git diff)
[ ] Create preview panel within visualization webview
[ ] Some way to select two nodes and find all paths between them
    - Idea: Select one node and ctrl+click on the other?
[ ] Slider/input to control dependency depth
[ ] Option to toggle simulation temperature i.e. simulation won't move
[ ] Use editor background color for settings panel (don't question this)
[ ] Minimal filenames
[ ] Support online URIs
[ ] ⭐️ Visualization of variable utilization
    - Track how a variable is referenced across files

-- COMPLETED --
[X] Create settings panel within visualization webview

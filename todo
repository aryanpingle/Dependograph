-- BUGS / FIXES / REFACTORS --
[ ] Show "add entry file" button only on valid files
[ ] Refactor settings to be a configuration instead of unique event listeners
[ ] Files aren't always sorted correctly (especially on adding / removing)

-- FEATURES --
[ ] importing types (type, interface, etc) should be counted differently
    - The visualization should have an option to exclude imports which are only types
[ ] Download visualization button
[ ] Find imports / exports within file (git diff)
[ ] Create preview panel within visualization webview
[ ] Some way to select two nodes and find all paths between them
    - Idea: Select one node and ctrl+click on the other?
[ ] Slider/input to control dependency depth
[ ] Option to toggle simulation temperature i.e. simulation won't move
[ ] Use editor background color for settings panel (don't question this)
[ ] Minimal filenames
[ ] Support online URIs
[ ] ⭐️ Visualization of variable utilization
    - Track how a variable is referenced across files

-- COMPLETED --
[X] Create settings panel within visualization webview
[X] Settings panel should have the background AND border of the editor hover widget
